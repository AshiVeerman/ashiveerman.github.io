# Lets do this!
As my winter vacations have started and I have nothing much to do :). 

I have decided to read one machine learning related paper everyday and record my learnings in a blog or a notion notebook (yet to decide) to increase my knowledge on the state-of-the-art techniques and the ongoing research.
