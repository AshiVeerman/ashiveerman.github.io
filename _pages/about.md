I am a final year undergraduate student at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Delhi from Mathematics and Computing Department. Some of the topics which I find interesting are Game Theory, Machine Learning, Optimisation techniques and random science facts :).

In my free time I like to draw and also find cool coding libraries to make art like p5js.
